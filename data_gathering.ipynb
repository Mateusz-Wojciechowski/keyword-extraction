movement to back election denier the delegate awarded will fuel the former president ahead of tuesday 5 march when 15 state will hold primary and trump nomination could be all but decided the michigan state party delegate met on saturday at the sprawling amway plaza hotel in grand rapid huddling in 13 separate meeting room representing the state 13 congressional district their nearuniform support for trump at the convention eclipsed the support he earned in the primary when former un ambassador nikki haley garnered about 26 of the vote she did not win any delegate awarded on saturday for the republican national convention in milwaukee where the party in july will officially nominate a candidate for the november presidential election the michigan republican party process for awarding delegate to the national committee wa complicated this year the democraticcontrolled state legislature decided to hold the presidential primary early this prompted the state republican party to create a hybrid model holding a primary on 27 february and a convention four day later to remain in compliance with the national party rule the convention on saturday at time took on the tone of a campaign rally president trump im going to help you win michigan exclaimed bernadette smith a michigan republican party activist running to be michigan republican national convention committeewoman during a speech at the convention saturday im from detroit i wa raised in detroit said smith to cheer detroit is red they just dont know it yet but if delegate found common cause today it wa only in their

about how to salvage the party from financial collapse the division fomenting in the party broke into the open this year in a leadership dispute when a group opposing the former michigan gop chair kristina karamo voted to oust her in january the republican national committee in february recognized pete hoekstra a close trump ally whom karamos opponent elected to chair the party a the rightful leader of the michigan gop karamo and her ally refused to accept defeat vowing to hold a separate convention in detroit which fell apart only after a judge ruled on tuesday that karamo had been properly removed from her seat and forbade her from using official michigan gop social medium account or accessing it finance before she wa elected last year to chair the michigan republican party karamo made a name for herself a a vocal proponent of trump false claim of widespread voter fraud during the 2020 election in michigan karamo went on to run for michigan secretary of state the office overseeing election in the state in 2022 she lost by 14 point but never conceded karamo who ha developed a reputation for floating outlandish conspiracy theory and who embrace christian nationalism ha referred to the split within the party a a form of spiritual warfare and her political opponent a demonic rhetoric embraced by section of the growing rightwing pentecostal movement in the u republican
